# JavaScript Racer

## Introduction

We are going to implement a "racer game" using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  This will be your second "formal" challenge to assess your knowledge of programming fundamentals and HTML/CSS.

You will be working individually for this assignment, but we'll be guiding you as you get started.


## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Your game should have two pages: a landing page and a game page
- Include separate HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
- Choose an existing landing page on the web; screen shot the landing page, and replicate its design to create a separate game landing page that links to your game\*
- Style your landing page and game page with class-based CSS
- Include a media query for a tablet to make your pages responsive
- Your game page must have at least two player objects
- Your game must have a clear win condition
- Comment your code appropriately
- Adhere to the [AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es5-deprecated/es5) for writing your JavaScript
- Adhere to the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml) for writing your HTML/CSS

\* This does NOT mean copy-and-paste, you must work from the screen shot, not the code.

**Bonus:**

- Use images to create a background and/or players
- Score each game based on the time it took to complete and by how much time they beat the opposing player
- Display the time it took for the player to complete the race
- Make a 'Best of 3' tournament and display the winner of the tournament
- Keep track of best times/ high scores across page refreshes using `localStorage`
- Add animations
- Have players do something other than simply pressing a key to move their player, for example, make them type words, or solve simple math problems

#### Starter code

There is no starter code for this project. You will have to make your own. Here are some tips on how to get started:

- Start simple! Ask yourself what the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of this project is
- Create HTML and CSS files that create one red square div and one blue, lined up on the left side of the screen
- Add a keydown event listener that console logs "blue move" or "red move"
- Replace that console log with JavaScript that moves the red or blue div a little to the right
- Run with it from there!
- If you are stuck on a problem, use pseudo-coding and OOP to break it down into smaller, more solvable problems

#### Deliverable

You should turn in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as a GitHub repository (fork or separate repo).  In your readme file, include a screenshot of the webpage you've used to build your landing page.

Here's a screenshot of what a game page might look like:
